        <h2>Background info:</h2>
        <p>ENQUIRE project started by Tim Berners-Lee in 1980. Other considered names were “The Mine of Information” and
          “The
          Information Mesh”.</p>
        <p>ENQUIRE was a simple <a href="definitions.html">hypertext</a> program.</p>
        <p>When Tim Berners-Lee came back to CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in 1984 he used ENQUIRE
          but
          ran
          into problems.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1985-1990:</h2>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee realized a new system was needed that was similar to ENQUIRE, "but accessible to everybody".
          People
          needed to be able to independently work on documents and link to other documents without updating the linked
          document. This was the base idea for the world wide web.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1989:</h2>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee started the development of <a href="definitions.html">HTTP</a> and made a simple document
          describing the behavior of a client
          and
          a server using the first <a href="definitions.html">HTTP</a> version, named 0.9.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>1990:</h2>
        <p>42% of American adults have used a computer. </p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee specified <a href="definitions.html">HTML</a> and wrote the server software and browser. </p>
        <p>The first version of this browser was made some time before December and was called <a
            href="https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/browser">“WorldWideWeb”</a>. (later
          renamed
          to Nexus to avoid confusion) </p>
        <p>WorldWideWeb would go on to release in 1991 and <a href="definitions.html">HTML</a> in 1993. </p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer became the first server with the first website. On the computer it says:
          “This
          machine is a server. DO NOT POWER DOWN!” </p>
